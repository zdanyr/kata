# Magic Year Calculator
## Overview
We have the following rules:
* Magic Year = work start year + 65
* Monthly salary = annual salary / 12 (rounded up)
* All calculation results should be rounded to the whole dollar. If >= 50 cents round up to the next dollar increment, otherwise round down.
For example, the following calculations would result with an annual salary of $60,050 starting work in the year 1980:â€‹
* Monthly salary = 60,050 / 12 = 5,004.16666667 (round down) = 5,004
* Magic year = 1980 + 65 = 2045
### Your Task
